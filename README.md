There are many workspaces which people can use to study or work, we wanted to make it easier to book any workspace in their area. We created a website with the main aim of booking workspaces. We wanted to give users the best and easiest way to choose their favorite workspaces to book them.
 Moreover, to simplify this process, we created a web app to accomodate users on the go ans users who prefer an app over a web page.
